## Introduction

This project focuses on revitalizing a retail store through advanced data analytics. Utilizing tools like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Tableau, the dataset from Kaggle is meticulously analyzed and visualized, leading to the creation of a predictive time series model for future sales. The goals include understanding state-wise and category-wise sales, optimizing stock for a new store, and identifying customer preferences.
